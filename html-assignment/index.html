    <p>Hi, this is Lindsey. I'm an international student from China. I like arts and design. I really like my current
        program <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. If I could have one item with me, That would be a pen
        so I can write and draw
        at any time. Besides, I’d like to tell you that I really like language as I am a Chinese native speaker and I've
        learned Japanese, French, and English before.
    </p>

    <P>I see myself in <em>Canada</em> or even United States in 2<sup>th</sup> grade because I prefer living in a
        pluralistic immigrating country. I'm into diverse Asian food not only Chinese food from my country but also
        sushi and sashimi from Japan and pho from Vietnam.

    </P>

    <P>People with passion can change the world for the better (Steve Jobs).</P>
